"""Interactive page ops via patchright (click / fill / submit / screenshot).

Phase 3 Task 1 (wet-local) — temporary home for ``InteractOps`` until the
class is contributed back to ``web-core`` per spec section 5.7. Once
upstream ships ``web_core.browsers.patchright.InteractOps``, this module
becomes a re-export shim and eventually deletes.

Design:
    Stateful helper bound to a single patchright ``Page``. Each method
    first attempts the native patchright call; on ``TimeoutError`` falls
    back to a best-effort "wait for selector then retry" path.

The selector-inference (LLM-resolved selector when raw selector is missing)
fallback is a NICE per spec section 4.2 — we expose ``description`` as an
input but resolve it with a deterministic CSS-like heuristic in this
in-tree implementation. The web-core contribution will swap in the full
``web_core.scraper.selector_inference`` LLM resolver.
